# Music-Player

Running MusicPlayer.exe will open up a gui from which you can edit playlists, and control music.  
Double clicking on a playlist will open up the playlist viewer, from which you can add/delete songs and  
even imbed other playlists. If there are no songs to add, you need to move files into the MusicPlayer folder.  

**NOTE:**  
The first time you run music player it creates a folder called MusicPlayer, you will have to move    
any mp3's and mp4's into that folder to be added to the player.
